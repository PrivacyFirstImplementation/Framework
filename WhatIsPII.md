Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is a broad category of data that can be used to identify a specific individual. The definition of PII can vary depending on the jurisdiction and specific privacy laws, but generally, it encompasses a wide range of information.

## Direct Identifiers

Direct identifiers are pieces of information that can uniquely identify an individual on their own:

- Full name
- Social Security number (SSN)
- Driver's license number
- Passport number
- Email address
- Physical address
- Phone number
- Biometric data (e.g., fingerprints, facial scans)
- Credit or debit card numbers
- Financial account information[1][4]

## Quasi-Identifiers

Quasi-identifiers are pieces of information that, when combined with other data, can identify an individual:

- Date of birth
- Place of birth
- Gender
- Race or ethnicity
- Age
- Geographic data[1][4]

## Additional PII Categories

Depending on the specific privacy law or regulation, PII may also include:

- IP addresses
- Cookie data
- RFID tags
- Medical records
- Employment information
- Education history
- Mother's maiden name
- Biometric records[2][5]

## PII Under Different Regulations

### GDPR (European Union)

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has a broad definition of personal data, which includes:

- Basic identity information
- Web data (location, IP address, cookie data)
- Health and genetic data
- Biometric data
- Racial or ethnic data
- Political opinions
- Sexual orientation[5]

### CCPA (California, USA)

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) defines personal information as:

"Information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household."[3]

This includes device IDs, cookies, IP addresses, and even aliases and account names[3].

### HIPAA (United States Healthcare)

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) specifically protects health-related PII, including:

- Medical records
- Insurance information
- Billing information
- Dates of service for health visits
- Correspondence between provider and patient[9]

It's important to note that the definition of PII continues to evolve as technology advances and new forms of data collection emerge. Organizations handling personal data must stay informed about the latest regulations and implement appropriate measures to protect individuals' privacy[4][6].
